# CS305_Module5
This repository is meant for the completion of module 5 of my CS305 class

A future project I want to eventually develope is a private server in which I can manage a firewall through scripts and vim, most
likely hosted on Redhat, since that is the linux server OS I am most familiar. 

I would use github in order to save startup scripts and other .sh files I would need to make frequent changes to.   
  
### Basic Toggle Script
Implementation of 3 scripts to set firewall to High Security, Medium Security, and Off
